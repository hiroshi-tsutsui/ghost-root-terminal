## Key Events
- **Harsh Brake Detection Update:**
  - **Decision:** Aligned "Harsh Brake" threshold to **0.47G (16.6 km/h/s)** to match Motive (industry standard) for heavy-duty trucks.
  - **Reason:** Human reviewers rejected 0.3G events as "not dangerous". 0.3G is comfortable braking; 0.47G is the minimum for "Harsh" in trucking telematics.
  - **Action:** Updated `dot-sfty-backend` (`eventFinder.ts` and `README.md`) on branch `feat/align-brake-thresholds`. Removed "Very Harsh Brake" category (merged into single 0.47G standard).
- **Batch Sweep V4.1 (Threshold Tuning):**
  - **Anomaly:** TP (True Positive) sweep jobs failed to find input videos due to incorrect GCS path (`following_distance_tp_Jan19_Feb5` vs `seino_following_distance_true`).
  - **Corrective Action:** Re-submitted specific test `sweep-v4-1-tp-exp-03-warn40` with corrected path.
  - **Results (Exp 03):** 
    - Configuration: Dist **18.0m**, Persist **1.8s**, Warn **40.0m**.
    - **False Positives (Danger in Safe set):** 444 (Lowest in batch).
    - **True Positives (Recall in Danger set):** 268/368 (**72.8%**).
    - **Conclusion:** `exp_03` is the confirmed winner. 1.8s persistence reduces FPs significantly while maintaining ~73% recall.
- **Project Omega:**
  - **Status:** **LIVE** at `https://projectomega-tau.vercel.app`.
  - **Issue:** Hit Vercel daily deployment limit (>100). "Pepper" sub-agent paused deployment attempts for several hours.
  - **Sub-agents:** `ghost_root` features (Netcat, firewall, Tor) deployed successfully after limit reset.
- **Infrastructure:**
  - **Critical:** `yolo:latest` Docker image is missing `ultralytics` and `torch`. This caused `env-probe-v1` to fail. Needs rebuild before training jobs.
- **Video Data:**
  - Downloaded 377 harsh brake event videos to `~/Desktop/harsh_brake/`.

## Active Context
- **Avengers Protocol:** **DISABLED**. Reverted to standard cron operation (Vision & Pepper only).
- **Current Winner:** Following Distance model `exp_03` (18m / 1.8s).
