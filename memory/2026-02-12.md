## 00:20 - Ghost Root Support (SSH Puzzle)
User is stuck on the SSH level in Ghost Root.
- **Issue 1:** `.ssh` directory is hidden from `ls -a` but accessible via `cd`.
  - *Analysis:* This is likely a bug in the `ls` command implementation in the game. `ls -a` should show all dotfiles.
- **Issue 2:** SSH connection timeout (`192.168.1.99`).
  - *Analysis:* The user fixed permissions (`chmod 600 id_rsa`), which is correct. The timeout suggests the target IP `192.168.1.99` might be down, firewall blocked, or requires a specific network condition (like being on the VPN/Tor).
  - *Hint:* In previous updates, we added `tor` and `proxychains` or similar routing logic. Or maybe the IP is wrong.
  - *Correction:* The `known_hosts` file lists `192.168.1.5`. The user is trying `.99` (Black Site). They might need to check `scan` or `netstat` or `route` to find the real target, or maybe the "Black Site" requires a VPN/Proxy connection first.
  - *Actually:* The error "Connection timed out" usually implies a firewall or routing issue in this game's lore.

## Plan
1.  **Acknowledge the bug:** `.ssh` should be visible with `ls -a`. I'll fix that.
2.  **Guide the user:**
    - `chmod 600 id_rsa` was the correct first step (they did it).
    - The timeout on `192.168.1.99` is part of the puzzle.
    - *Hint:* They might need to be on the right network. Did they run `wifi scan` or `nmcli`? Or maybe the host is actually `192.168.1.5` (from `known_hosts`)?
    - Let's check the game code to see the intended solution for the "Black Site" SSH connection.

I need to read the Ghost Root source code to confirm the solution and fix the `ls -a` bug.
