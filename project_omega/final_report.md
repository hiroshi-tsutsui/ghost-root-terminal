# Mission Report: Innovation - Quadratic Functions

## Accomplishments
1.  **Created Interactive Module:** `app/math/quadratic/page.tsx`
    -   Implemented a real-time canvas visualizer for quadratic functions (`y = ax^2 + bx + c`).
    -   Added interactive sliders for coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c`.
    -   Designed a "snappy" UI with a dark mode aesthetic (Project Omega style).
2.  **Localization:**
    -   Added English keys to `locales/en.json` (`math_quadratic`).
    -   Added Japanese keys to `locales/ja.json` ("二次関数イノベーション").
3.  **Integration:**
    -   Added a new card to the dashboard in `app/page.tsx`.
    -   Linked the card to `/math/quadratic`.
    -   Categorized under "TIER 2: THE MOTION".

## Details for Main Agent
-   **Path:** The new module is located at `/math/quadratic`.
-   **Tech:** Uses HTML5 Canvas for performance and React state for interactivity.
-   **Status:** The module is marked as "NEW" and "TIER 2" in the dashboard.
-   **Verification:** Code is clean, imports are correct relative to the new nested structure.

The module is ready for deployment.
