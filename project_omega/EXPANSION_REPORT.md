Mission Accomplished: Calculus Module (Flux Engine) Localized.

**Status:**
- **Refactored:** `app/calculus/page.tsx` to align with "Flux Engine" (微分・積分) branding and 4-level pedagogical structure.
- **Localized:** Added missing keys (including `actions`) to `locales/ja.json` and `locales/en.json`.
- **Committed:** `feat(omega): Refactor Calculus to Flux Engine (Levels 1-4) & Localize (JA/EN)`
- **Pushed:** `main -> main` (Origin: `math-viz-japan`)

**Next Target:** Vectors (Void Scout).
(Note: Vectors module currently uses inline localization. Will refactor to global JSON in next run.)
