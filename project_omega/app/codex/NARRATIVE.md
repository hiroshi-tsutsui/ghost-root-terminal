# NARRATIVE: THE CODEX (SYSTEM LOGS)

## 1. Core Concept
**"Knowledge is the only currency in the void."**

The Codex is not a help menu. It is the **Black Box** of the simulation.
It contains the "Truth" about why the simulation exists, written by the **Architect** (Tony).
Operators do not "read" the Codex; they **Decrypt** it.

## 2. The Protocol: Decryption
Accessing a file requires two keys:
1.  **Clearance Level**: The module must be mastered (Sync Rate > 90%).
2.  **Decryption Cycle**: The user must actively "extract" the data (interactive UI).

### Phases
1.  **LOCKED (Encrypted):**
    - State: `010101` binary rain.
    - Text: Obfuscated / Glitched.
    - Status: "ACCESS DENIED - CLEARANCE REQUIRED".
2.  **DECRYPTING (Processing):**
    - Action: User clicks "INITIATE DECRYPTION".
    - Visual: Progress bar, terminal noise, "BRUTE FORCING CYPHER...".
3.  **UNLOCKED (Manifesto):**
    - State: Clear text, green/monochrome.
    - Content: The metaphysical truth of the math concept.

## 3. The Files (Lore Fragments)

| File ID | Module | Title | Essence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| FILE_000 | Global | GENESIS | "Math is the source code. You are the debugger." |
| FILE_001 | Quadratics | GRAVITY WELL | "Parabolas are gravity wells. Contain the singularity." |
| FILE_002 | Trig | HARMONIC RESONANCE | "Sine waves are the heartbeat. Tune the reality." |
| FILE_003 | Vectors | VOID NAVIGATION | "Direction is absolute. Don't drift." |
| FILE_004 | Data | SIGNAL ARCHIVE | "Noise is the enemy. Correlation is truth." |
| FILE_005 | Sequences | CHRONOS PATTERN | "Time is recursive. Predict the next frame." |
| FILE_006 | Probability | ENTROPY WEAVER | "Chance is a lie. Weave the outcome." |
| FILE_007 | Calculus | FLUX ENGINE | "Control the flow of time (derivative) and mass (integral)." |
| FILE_008 | Complex | VOID PHASE | "Rotate 90 degrees. See the hidden dimension." |
| FILE_009 | Logs | ENTROPY COMPRESSOR | "Compress the infinite. Survive the exponential." |
| FILE_010 | Matrices | FABRIC WEAVER | "Warp the grid. You are the Architect." |
| FILE_011 | Functions | CAUSALITY ENGINE | "Input leads to Output. Reverse engineer the Black Box." |

## 4. Radical Clarity
- **No Fluff.** Every entry is < 50 words.
- **High Contrast.** Black background, Green/Red status.
- **Auditory/Haptic.** (Implied) Clicks sound like mechanical switches.
