# OPERATOR PROFILE: THE SHADOW

## Concept
The "Operator Profile" is not just a user account page; it is the **Digital Shadow** of the Operator within the Omega Simulation. It represents their synchronization level with the mathematical fabric of reality.

## Narrative Layer
"The Operator is the interface between the chaotic void and the structured simulation. As you stabilize more sectors (modules), your Digital Shadow gains definition. A low-level Operator is barely a ghost in the machine. A high-level Operator is a solid anchor point for reality."

## Visual Identity
- **Aesthetic:** Cyberpunk / ID Card / Classified Dossier.
- **Colors:** Green (Stable), Yellow (Fluctuating), Red (Critical).
- **Key Elements:**
  - **Clearance Level:** (e.g., "Level 5 Architect").
  - **Sync Rate:** Overall percentage of completion.
  - **Sector Stability:** A visual breakdown of module mastery (Radar Chart or Bar Graph).
  - **Achievements:** Medals for "Perfect Sync" or "Speed Run".

## Mechanics
- **Data Source:** `ProgressContext` (XP, Level, Module Progress).
- **Interactivity:**
  - **3D ID Card:** Rotatable card showing stats on back.
  - **Theme Toggle:** "Stealth Mode" vs "Active Mode".
