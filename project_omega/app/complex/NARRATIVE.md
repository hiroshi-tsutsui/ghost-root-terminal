# PROTOCOL: VOID RESONANCE (Complex Numbers)

> "The Material Plane is only half the picture. To bypass the wall, you must rotate through the Void."
> — Architect Tony, Log 404

## 1. The Operational Truth
In standard education, "Imaginary Numbers" are taught as a mathematical curiosity or a workaround for negative roots.
**In Project Omega, they are a Navigation Tool.**

- **Real Axis (x):** The Material Plane. Where we live. Visible, tangible.
- **Imaginary Axis (y):** The Void. A hidden dimension perpendicular to reality.
- **Complex Number ($z$):** A coordinate in this combined phase-space.
- **Multiplication by $i$:** A literal **90-degree rotation** out of the Material Plane and into the Void.

## 2. Operator Mission
The System is plagued by "Linear Obstructions"—walls that exist only on the Real Axis. You cannot go *through* them. You must go *around* them using the Void.

**Your Objective:**
Use the **Phase Operator ($z_2$)** to rotate the **Source Signal ($z_1$)** until it achieves **Resonance** (alignment with a cardinal axis) or bypasses a blockade.

## 3. The Mechanics

### A. The Pivot ($i$)
- **Input:** A signal trapped on the Real Axis (e.g., $1$).
- **Action:** Apply the Phase Operator $i$.
- **Result:** The signal rotates to $i$ (Pure Void). It is now invisible to Material sensors.
- **Lore:** "Cloaking active. We are in the Void."

### B. The Spiral ($1 + i$)
- **Input:** A weak signal.
- **Action:** Apply Operator $1+i$.
- **Result:** The signal rotates 45° AND scales up by $\sqrt{2}$.
- **Lore:** "Amplification through phase-shifting. Energy drawn from the Void."

### C. The Mirror (Conjugate $\bar{z}$)
- **Input:** A corrupted signal ($a + bi$).
- **Action:** Apply the Conjugate Protocol (flip the imaginary component).
- **Result:** The imaginary noise cancels out when combined ($z \cdot \bar{z} = a^2 + b^2$).
- **Lore:** "Noise negation. Signal purified to Real energy."

## 4. System Feedback
- **Phase Locked:** Signal is perfectly aligned (Pure Real or Pure Imaginary).
- **Unstable:** Signal is drifting ($a + bi$ with high variance).
- **Critical Resonance:** A perfect rotation that lands exactly on a target node.

## 5. Future Expansion (Phase 3)
- **Euler's Formula ($e^{i\pi}$):** The ultimate rotation. A perfect half-circle through the Void to invert polarity.
- **Mandelbrot Rendering:** Visualizing the "Coastline of the Void".
