# NARRATIVE: THE CAUSALITY ENGINE (Functions)

## 1. Core Concept
**Mathematics:** Functions ($f(x)$) mapping Inputs to Outputs.
**Omega Lore:** "Causality." The mechanism that translates *intent* (Input) into *reality* (Output).
**The Problem:** The Simulation's causality algorithms are drifting. Inputs are triggering incorrect Outputs (e.g., $x=2$ resulting in $y=Error$).
**The Role:** The Operator acts as a **Causality Debugger**.

## 2. Terminology
- **Domain ($x$):** "Trigger Space" / The Source.
- **Range ($y$):** "Manifestation Space" / The Effect.
- **Function ($f$):** "The Law" / The Black Box.
- **Inverse ($f^{-1}$):** "Retro-Causality" / Traceback Protocol.
- **Composite ($f \circ g$):** "Chain Reaction".

## 3. Visual Language
- **Aesthetic:** Industrial / Server Room / "The Matrix" Construct.
- **Palette:** Amber (Warning), White (Pure Data), Grey (Machinery).
- **Metaphor:** A literal "Engine" where raw data flows in, gets processed by gears/circuits (the Function), and flows out as refined reality.

## 4. Mission Protocol: "The Black Box"
**Objective:** Deduce the hidden Law ($f(x)$) by observing Inputs and Outputs.

### Phase 1: Linear Drift
- **Briefing:** "Operator, the engine is misfiring. Inputs are scaling linearly but the offset is unknown."
- **Task:** Given $x \to y$ pairs (e.g., $1 \to 3, 2 \to 5$), identify $f(x) = 2x + 1$.
- **Interaction:** "Inject Test Signal". Watch the output.

### Phase 2: Non-Linear Surge
- **Briefing:** "Power surge detected. Output is expanding exponentially."
- **Task:** Identify the exponent. $f(x) = x^2$ or $2^x$?
- **Mechanics:** Visual "Overload" warning if the guess is too low.

### Phase 3: The Chain (Composite)
- **Briefing:** "Multiple systems linked. Input passes through Alpha then Beta."
- **Task:** Calculate $g(f(x))$.
- **Visual:** Two boxes in series. $x \to [f] \to [g] \to y$.
