# PROTOCOL: FABRIC WEAVER

> "Space is not a void. It is a fabric. You are the needle."

## 1. Core Concept
The **Fabric Weaver** protocol teaches **Linear Transformations** (Matrices) by framing them as manipulations of the space-time grid.
The Operator must input the correct transformation matrix to align their local reality (Blue Grid) with the Target Reality (Red Ghost Grid).

## 2. Terminology
- **The Fabric**: The 2D Coordinate System.
- **Weaving**: Applying a Matrix Transformation.
- **i-hat (Red Vector)**: The "X-Axis Anchor".
- **j-hat (Green Vector)**: The "Y-Axis Anchor".
- **Determinant**: "Fabric Tension" (Area scaling factor).

## 3. The Mission: Grid Stabilization
The local reality is drifting. The Operator must lock it back into phase with the stable timeline.

### Phase 1: Orientation Lock (Rotation)
- **Briefing**: "Local gravity is spinning. Re-align the horizon."
- **Task**: Rotate the grid 90 degrees or 180 degrees.
- **Key Insight**: Where does i-hat go? Where does j-hat go?

### Phase 2: Expansion Protocol (Scaling)
- **Briefing**: "Spatial compression detected. Expand the grid to match standard variance."
- **Task**: Scale the grid by 2x or 0.5x.
- **Key Insight**: Diagonal elements control stretch.

### Phase 3: Shear Stress (Shear)
- **Briefing**: "Dimensional slip detected. Apply lateral force to compensate."
- **Task**: Shear the grid (push the top, keep the bottom).
- **Key Insight**: Off-diagonal elements cause the grid to lean.

## 4. System Logs (Flavor Text)
- "INITIATING FABRIC WEAVER..."
- "WARNING: GRID TENSION CRITICAL."
- "STATUS: SINGULARITY AVOIDED."
- "SYNC RATE: 100%."
