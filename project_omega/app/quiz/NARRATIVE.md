# PROTOCOL: CALIBRATION (The Gauntlet)

## 1. Core Concept
The **Calibration Protocol** (formerly "Quiz") is the entry point for all new Operators. It is not a test of knowledge; it is a test of **System Stability**.

The Omega Simulation is unstable. The Operator's presence introduces "Cognitive Dissonance" (errors). The goal is to synchronize the Operator's mental model with the Simulation's logic before the system collapses.

## 2. Terminology
- **Anomalies**: Math problems. These are "glitches" in the simulation that must be resolved.
- **Sync Rate**: The score. Represents the alignment between Operator and System.
- **Stability**: Time limit. The system is actively decaying. Speed is essential.
- **Clearance Level**: The rank awarded based on performance (Omega, Architect, Operator, Initiate).

## 3. The Narrative Arc
### Phase 1: Initiation
- **Context**: The user enters a "High-Pressure Environment".
- **Visuals**: Red/Black warning lights. "SYSTEM UNSTABLE".
- **Goal**: Resolve immediate anomalies to prevent total collapse.

### Phase 2: Stabilization
- **Action**: Answering questions correctly "Patches" the code.
- **Feedback**: Green flash. "ANOMALY NEUTRALIZED". Stability +15%.
- **Fail State**: Answering incorrectly causes "Data Corruption". Stability -25%.

### Phase 3: Synchronization
- **Outcome**:
  - **High Sync (90%+)**: "OMEGA CLEARANCE GRANTED". The user is a stabilizing force.
  - **Mid Sync (50-89%)**: "OPERATOR STATUS CONFIRMED". Functional but imperfect.
  - **Low Sync (<50%)**: "INITIATE LEVEL ONLY". Access restricted (narratively).

## 4. Mechanics
- **Real-Time Decay**: Stability drops by 1% every second.
- **Restoration**: Correct answers restore 15% Stability.
- **Penalty**: Wrong answers drop Stability by 25%.
- **Critical Failure**: If Stability hits 0%, the protocol aborts (Game Over / Retry).

## 5. System Logs (Lore Fragments)
- "DETECTING COGNITIVE DISSONANCE..."
- "WARNING: ENTROPY INCREASING."
- "FLUX ENGINE: STABILIZED."
- "VOID PHASE: ALIGNED."
- "CRITICAL: SYSTEM PURGE IMMINENT."
