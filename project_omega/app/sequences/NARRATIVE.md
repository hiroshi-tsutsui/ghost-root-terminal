# PROTOCOL: CHRONOS PATTERN RECOGNITION

## 1. Core Concept
**"The past dictates the future. Unless you interfere."**

In the Omega Simulation, time is not continuous; it is discrete. It moves in steps ($n$). The Void attempts to diverge into chaos (infinite growth or random fluctuation). The Operator's role is to identify the pattern and stabilize the timeline.

You are the **Predictor**.

## 2. Terminology
- **Anchor Point ($a$):** The initial state. Where the timeline begins.
- **Linear Velocity ($d$):** Constant change. Arithmetic Progression. "Stable Time Loop."
- **Divergence Factor ($r$):** Multiplicative change. Geometric Progression. "Exponential Runaway."
- **Stasis Lock:** When a sequence converges to a limit. The end of history.
- **Recursion:** A loop that references itself. Dangerous if unchecked.

## 3. Mission Profile

### Phase 1: Linear Stabilization
* **Objective:** Predict $n+1$.
* **Briefing:** "The timeline is drifting at a constant rate. Calculate the velocity ($d$). Intercept the event horizon."
* **Mechanic:** Identify the common difference. Predict the next term.

### Phase 2: Entropy Dampening
* **Objective:** Contain Exponential Growth ($r > 1$).
* **Briefing:** "CRITICAL ALERT. Divergence factor exceeds safety limits. The timeline is expanding too fast. Calculate the scale factor ($r$) and dampen the signal."
* **Mechanic:** Identify the common ratio. Predict the explosive term before overflow.

### Phase 3: Stasis Protocol
* **Objective:** Find the Limit ($|r| < 1$).
* **Briefing:** "The energy is dissipating. The timeline is converging to a single point. Locate the Stasis Coordinate."
* **Mechanic:** Calculate the sum to infinity or the limit of the sequence.

> "We used to think time flowed like a river. It doesn't. It ticks like a clock. Every second is a calculation. Every minute is a sum."

> **FRAGMENT: RECURSION_01**
> "Beware the loop that feeds on itself. Without an exit condition, it consumes all memory."
