# NARRATIVE: THE FLUX ENGINE (CALCULUS)

## Identity
- **Module Name:** Flux Engine
- **Operator Role:** Temporal Stabilizer
- **Core Concept:** "Change is the only constant. Master the rate, master the future."

## The Lore
In the Omega Simulation, time is not linear; it is a variable function. The **Flux Engine** allows the Operator to perceive the instantaneous rate of change (Differentiation) and the accumulation of history (Integration).

Without this module, the simulation stutters. Events happen without cause, and consequences fail to accumulate.

## Operator Objectives
1.  **Stabilize the Tangent:**
    - *Task:* Align the derivative at critical points (maxima/minima).
    - *Meaning:* Predict the turning points of fate before they happen.

2.  **Accumulate Reality:**
    - *Task:* Calculate the area under the curve.
    - *Meaning:* Sum up the total impact of continuous actions.

## Unlockable Fragments
> "The First Derivative is not a number; it is a prophecy. It tells you where you are going, not where you are."
> — *Architect Protocol v0.9*

> "Integration is the memory of the universe. Nothing is lost, only accumulated."
> — *The First Operator*

## UI/UX Flavor
- **Derivative:** "Predicting Trajectory..."
- **Integral:** "Accumulating Mass..."
- **Error:** "Discontinuity Detected. Reality Fractured."
