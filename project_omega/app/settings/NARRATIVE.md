# PROTOCOL: SYSTEM_OVERRIDE (Settings)

## 1. Core Concept
The Operator is not merely observing the simulation; they are *interfacing* with it. This interface can be unstable. The "System Override" protocol allows the Operator to adjust the parameters of the simulation to match their cognitive load capacity.

## 2. Narrative Justification
- **Audio:** "Auditory Feedback Loop". Some Operators experience resonance feedback. Need a way to dampen the signal.
- **Visuals:** "Render Fidelity". High-frequency visual stimuli can cause neural drift. Low-fidelity mode stabilizes the optic nerve.
- **Data Reset:** "Memory Purge". Sometimes the local cache becomes corrupted with noise. A full purge is the only way to re-sync with the Source.

## 3. The Experience
- **Aesthetic:** High-contrast, industrial, "Backend" feel. No fancy animations—just raw switches and terminal commands.
- **Tone:** Warning labels. "CAUTION: PURGE IRREVERSIBLE".
- **Interaction:** Every change feels physical. A distinct "click" or "shudder" (visual).

## 4. Key Mechanics
- **Sensory Dampening:** Mute global audio / Reduce motion.
- **Kernel Panic:** A hidden "Debug Mode" that shows raw system logs.
- **Hard Reset:** Wipe `localStorage` to restart the journey from Candidate status.
