# NARRATIVE LAYER: VECTOR NAVIGATION SYSTEM

## Core Concept
The **Vector Navigation System** is the module responsible for spatial awareness and propulsion within the Omega Simulation. Without mastery of vectors, the Operator cannot navigate the infinite void of the mathematical plane.

## The Operator's Role
You are the **Navigator**. Your task is to calibrate the directional thrusters and stabilization gyroscopes of the simulation's observation drones.

## Narrative Elements

### 1. Protocol Name: `VECTOR_SYNC`
- **Old Name:** Sensei Mode
- **New Context:** Initiating synchronization with the spatial navigation subroutines.

### 2. Mission Re-skinning
- **Level 1 (Dot Product):** "Gyroscopic Stabilization".
  - *Context:* Calibrating orthogonal thrusters. When the dot product is 0, thrusters are perfectly independent (orthogonal).
- **Level 2 (Cross Product):** "Torque Generation".
  - *Context:* Generating rotational force to orient the drone. The cross product defines the axis of rotation.
- **Level 3 (Normal Vectors):** "Landing Protocol".
  - *Context:* Aligning with the docking platform. The normal vector must match the platform's orientation for a safe landing.

## Terminology
- **Sensei** -> **System (Omega)**
- **Student** -> **Operator**
- **Lesson** -> **Calibration Sequence**
- **Good Job** -> **Calibration Complete. Efficiency Increased.**

## Visual Cues
- **UI Label:** "NAVIGATION SYSTEMS: ONLINE"
- **Color Palette:** Maintain the clean scientific look, but emphasize "Precision" (Blue/Green).
