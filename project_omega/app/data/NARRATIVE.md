# Protocol: Signal Archive (Data Analysis)

## 1. The Narrative
**"The Void is full of noise. Only the pattern survives."**

The Archive is a repository of fractured data streams from the Omega Event. 
Most of it is static—entropy eating away at the truth. 
Your task as an Operator is to **Decouple the Signal from the Noise**.
You must align the **Carrier Wave** (Regression Line) until the **Coherence Integrity** (Correlation Coefficient) stabilizes.

## 2. The Mission
Stabilize the corrupted data streams by injecting valid signal nodes and purging anomalous outliers.

### Phase 1: Signal Injection
- **Objective:** Establish a baseline Carrier Wave.
- **Action:** Inject 5 Signal Nodes that align with the phantom trace.
- **Threshold:** Coherence > 0.90.

### Phase 2: Noise Purge
- **Objective:** Eliminate interference.
- **Action:** The system will inject noise (outliers). Remove them to restore integrity.
- **Threshold:** Coherence > 0.95.

### Phase 3: The Archive Lock
- **Objective:** Full synchronization.
- **Action:** Maintain a stable wave with high node density (>10 nodes).
- **Threshold:** Coherence > 0.99.

## 3. Terminology
| Standard Math | Omega Protocol |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Data Point** | Signal Node |
| **Regression Line** | Carrier Wave |
| **Residual** | Noise Variance |
| **Correlation (r)** | Coherence Integrity |
| **Outlier** | Anomaly |
| **Mean (x̄, ȳ)** | Signal Centroid |

## 4. System Logs (Unlockable)
- **Log_001:** "Static implies randomness. Patterns imply intent. We are looking for the intent."
- **Log_002:** "A single anomaly can drag the entire truth off course. This is the danger of unweighted perception."
- **Log_003:** "When the Signal-to-Noise ratio drops below zero, reality itself becomes subjective."
