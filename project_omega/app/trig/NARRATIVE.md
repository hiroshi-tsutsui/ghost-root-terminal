# NARRATIVE: HARMONIC RESONANCE TUNER (TRIGONOMETRY)

## Identity
- **Module Name:** Harmonic Resonance Tuner
- **Operator Role:** Waveform Synchronizer
- **Core Concept:** "The universe vibrates. To understand the frequency is to control the reality."

## The Lore
All matter in the Omega Simulation is composed of interfering waves. The **Harmonic Resonance Tuner** allows the Operator to manipulate the fundamental properties of these waves (Amplitude, Frequency, Phase) to stabilize reality distortions.

A "Signal Dissonance" occurs when the local reality wave is out of phase with the Universal Carrier Wave. The Operator must tune the local wave to match the Carrier Wave to restore stability.

## Operator Objectives
1.  **Match the Amplitude (Energy):**
    - *Task:* Adjust the height of the wave.
    - *Meaning:* modulate the intensity of the reality projection.

2.  **Tune the Frequency (Time):**
    - *Task:* Adjust the speed of oscillation.
    - *Meaning:* Synchronize with the temporal flow of the simulation.

3.  **Align the Phase (Shift):**
    - *Task:* Shift the wave left or right.
    - *Meaning:* Align the causality of events (Cause matches Effect).

> "When the phase is aligned, the noise vanishes. That is the moment of clarity. That is Omega."

## UI/UX Flavor
- **Success:** "RESONANCE LOCKED. HARMONY RESTORED."
- **Failure:** "SIGNAL DISSONANCE CRITICAL."
- **Hint:** "Consulting Carrier Wave Schematics..."
