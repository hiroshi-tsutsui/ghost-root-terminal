# PROTOCOL: HARMONIC RESONANCE TUNER (Trigonometry)

## MISSION BRIEFING
**CLEARANCE LEVEL:** 3 (OPERATOR)
**OBJECTIVE:** STABILIZE THE REALITY WAVEFORM.
**TARGET:** ELIMINATE DISSONANCE via HARMONIC ALIGNMENT.

## THE LORE
The Omega Simulation relies on a carrier wave to maintain coherence. Fluctuations in the "Void" cause this wave to drift, creating "Reality Static" (glitches, time skips).
As an Operator, you must use the **Harmonic Resonance Tuner** to match the drift and cancel it out via destructive interference (or constructive alignment, depending on the phase).

## MISSION PHASES (Levels)

### PHASE 1: ENERGY SYNCHRONIZATION (Amplitude)
**"The signal is faint. Boost the gain."**
- **Intel:** The wave's height represents its Energy State.
- **Task:** Match the Target Amplitude ($A$).
- **Constraint:** Frequency and Phase are locked.
- **Operator Note:** "Too weak, and we lose signal. Too strong, and we overload the buffer."

### PHASE 2: TEMPORAL HARMONICS (Frequency)
**"The timeline is drifting. Recalibrate the clock."**
- **Intel:** The wave's speed (cycles) represents Time Flow.
- **Task:** Match the Target Frequency ($B$).
- **Constraint:** Phase is locked. Amplitude is variable.
- **Operator Note:** "High frequency means time accelerates. Low frequency means stagnation."

### PHASE 3: REALITY DISPLACEMENT (Phase Shift)
**"We are out of sync with the present. Shift the phase."**
- **Intel:** The wave's horizontal position represents Reality Alignment.
- **Task:** Match the Target Phase Shift ($C$).
- **Constraint:** All parameters unlocked. Full manual control.
- **Operator Note:** "A 180-degree shift cancels the noise. A 360-degree shift is a full loop."

## VICTORY CONDITION
**"RESONANCE LOCKED [100%]"**
- The waveform stabilizes (turns Green/Gold).
- The "System Log" confirms "Reality Coherence Restored".
- **Reward:** Protocol Mastery + "Harmonic Tuner" Badge.
