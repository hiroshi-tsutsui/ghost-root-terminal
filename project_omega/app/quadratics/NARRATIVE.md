# NARRATIVE: GRAVITY WELL CALIBRATION (Quadratics)

## 1. Core Concept
**Mathematical Concept:** Quadratic Functions ($y = ax^2 + bx + c$)
**Omega Protocol:** "Gravity Well Stabilization"
**Role:** The Operator acts as a **Singularity Containment Engineer**.

The parabolic curve is interpreted as the cross-section of a **Gravity Well** (a distortion in spacetime). The "Vertex" is the **Singularity** (Point of Infinite Density). The Operator's job is to stabilize this well before it collapses or tears the fabric of the simulation.

## 2. Terminology Map
| Math Term | Omega Protocol Term | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Parabola** | **Gravity Well** | The spacetime curvature field. |
| **Vertex** | **Singularity** | The core of the anomaly. Must be contained. |
| **$a$ (Leading Coeff)** | **Field Strength** | Controls the intensity (narrowness) and polarity (direction). |
| **$c$ (Y-Intercept)** | **Vertical Offset** | Controls the depth of the well relative to the Observation Plane. |
| **$b$ (Linear Coeff)** | **Horizon Shift** | Controls the lateral drift of the singularity. |
| **Axis of Symmetry** | **Stabilization Vector** | The ideal alignment line ($x = -b/2a$). |

## 3. Mission Protocol: "The Collapse"

### Phase 1: Containment (Field Strength $a$)
*   **Briefing:** "Alert. Unstable Singularity detected. Field density is critical. Adjust Field Strength ($a$) to contain the event horizon."
*   **Action:**
    *   **$a > 1$:** "Compressing Event Horizon." (Narrow parabola)
    *   **$a < 0$:** "Inverting Polarity. Repelling debris." (Downward parabola)
*   **Success:** "Field Strength stabilized. Singularity contained."

### Phase 2: Depth Alignment (Vertical Offset $c$)
*   **Briefing:** "Singularity is drifting vertically. Re-align with the Galactic Plane (Axis Y=0)."
*   **Action:**
    *   **$c > 0$:** "Raising Singularity to Observation Deck."
    *   **$c < 0$:** "Lowering Singularity to Deep Storage."
*   **Success:** "Vertical alignment confirmed. Singularity locked in Deep Storage."

### Phase 3: Lateral Stabilization (Horizon Shift $b$)
*   **Briefing:** "Cross-winds detected. Singularity is drifting laterally. Compensate for drift."
*   **Action:**
    *   **Adjust $b$:** "Counter-steering... Drift Vector neutralized."
*   **Success:** "Lateral drift compensated. Apex coordinates locked. GRAVITY WELL STABILIZED."

## 4. Operator Rewards (Unlockable Lore)
*   **Clearance Level:** "Gravity Engineer"
*   **Sync Rate Increase:** +12%
*   **Lore Fragment:** "The Parabola is not just a curve; it is the shape of consequence. What goes up must come down, unless it escapes velocity. You control the fall."
