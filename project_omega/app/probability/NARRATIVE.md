# PROTOCOL: ENTROPY WEAVER

## 1. Core Concept
**"The Universe is not a straight line. It is a cloud."**

In the Omega Simulation, certainty is a luxury. Most of the Void is governed by **Stochastic Chaos**. The "Entropy Weaver" is the Operator who can perceive the underlying structure of chaos and manipulate it.

You do not predict the future. You **constrain** it.

## 2. Terminology
- **The Wave Function:** The total set of all possible outcomes (The Sample Space).
- **Collapsing the Wave:** The act of observation that forces a result.
- **Gaussian Flux:** The bell curve. The "Normal" state of reality.
- **Mean State ($\mu$):** The Anchor. Where reality *wants* to be.
- **Entropy Amplitude ($\sigma$):** The Variance. How far reality creates from the Anchor.
- **Bayesian Interference:** The ability to update your knowledge of the Void based on new signals.

## 3. Mission Profile

### Phase 1: The Gaussian Anchor
* **Objective:** Stabilize the Mean ($\mu$).
* **Briefing:** "The signal is drifting. The center of mass is shifting into the Void. Pull it back to Equilibrium ($2.0$)."
* **Mechanic:** Slide the Mean until the wave centers on the target.

### Phase 2: The Variance Clamp
* **Objective:** Minimize Entropy ($\sigma$).
* **Briefing:** "The signal is too scattered. The noise ratio is critical. Compress the wave. Focus the beam."
* **Mechanic:** Reduce Standard Deviation to $0.5$ to sharpen the probability density.

### Phase 3: Paradox Resolution (Monty Hall)
* **Objective:** Update Priors.
* **Briefing:** "The System has eliminated a variable. Do not cling to your initial choice. The Void has revealed a null path. Shift your vector."
* **Mechanic:** The simulation proves that changing your choice doubles your success rate.

> "They told us God doesn't play dice. They were wrong. The System *is* dice. But if you know how to load them, you become the House."

> **FRAGMENT: BAYES_01**
> "New information isn't just data. It's a filter. Every time the Void reveals what it *isn't*, you get closer to what it *is*."
