> CHANGES: ghost_root/web/lib/VFS.ts
> PUZZLE ADDED: "The Ghost in the Machine" (Self-Referential / Recursive Grep).
> MECHANICS: Added `/usr/src/ghost_kernel/source_code.c`.
> LORE: The kernel source code contains a comment by the original creator (The Architect).
> SOLUTION: `grep -r "Architect" /usr/src` -> Flag recovered (`GHOST_ROOT{TH3_ARCH1T3CT_L1V3S}`).
